Learning Git repository

Hi everyone,

I´m me...just anotherone learning git to uses it as CVS for my "learning programming languages" journy.

I´m re-engaging with html-css and learning javascrit as my web page full-stack development plan. I´m already a t-sql script writer and DBA manager, and have done some coding in the past in basic, cobol, pascal, c/c++, ASP, PHP.

I´m trying to get serious about programming, that wil include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, R, T-SQL, and, who knows, a lot more (VUE, REACT, etc), We´ll see.
